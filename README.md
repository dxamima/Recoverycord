# Recoverycord
It's just normal Discord, but full of MacOS stuff

# Installation
To install, you must have a Discord Client Mod. If you don't have one, I recommend [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vesktop)
## Vencord
Head to **User Settings** > **Themes** > **Online Themes** and put the following URL in the box:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dxamima/Recoverycord/refs/heads/main/recoveryCordTheme.css
```
For other clients, download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dxamima/Recoverycord/refs/heads/main/recoveryCordTheme.css), add it to your Themes folder and you are ready to go!
